"""Power songs: how fast you swam while each track played, from the watch's per-length data.

Every pool length has a start time, so it belongs to the track that was playing then. Three things keep that honest:
- the music starts before the watch (shower, warm-up: `warmup_minutes`), and that gap is a guess, so each length is
  spread over the tracks playing within +-UNCERTAINTY_MINUTES of it rather than pinned to one;
- the watch's mistakes are repaired: a missed turn (double time, double strokes) is two lengths, a stop is dropped;
- each length is compared with your average for the same stroke in that swim (breaststroke is not slow freestyle).
Per track that gives a speed relative to you that day, averaged over swims and shrunk towards zero until there are
enough lengths to trust. The mix then favours the tracks that make you faster.
