"""Judge every pool track against your listening history and sort it into a bucket.

obsession  by an artist you are into right now (decayed artist plays), any of their tracks
mid        played within the last 90 days, artist not hot
lost       played before (2+ times or loved), silent for 90+ days
fresh      never played, but by an artist you played in the past year
rec        never played, artist unknown to you (discovery), boosted when Last.fm calls it similar

Obsession is defined by *artist*, not by track: in your history only ~9% of a month's plays are tracks
from the month before, but 32% of the new-to-you tracks are by an artist you played that month.
